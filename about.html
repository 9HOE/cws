  <h2>About Casey's Web Solutions</h2>

  <p>
    My name is <strong>Casey Ty Lenio</strong>, founder of Casey’s Web Solutions.
    I specialize in creating professional websites for barbershops and small businesses.
  </p>

  <p>
    I started this agency after seeing how many great local businesses either
    didn’t have a website or had one that didn’t reflect the quality of their work.
  </p>

  <p>
    My mission is simple: build clean, modern websites that help businesses
    look professional, build trust, and attract more clients online —
    without overpriced contracts or confusing tech.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you work with me, you communicate directly with the owner.
    No middlemen, no sales teams, and no hidden fees.
  </p>

  <p>
    I focus on clear communication, fast turnaround times (typically 7–10 days),
    and honest pricing so business owners know exactly what they’re getting.
